**hyphens** (use to avoid ambiguity)

Double hyphens: Don’t use them. Instead, use the em dash (—). These are long dashes, the equivalent length of an M (—), used to set off parenthetical text or digressive elements. There should be no space on either side: `This has been a long haul—to Hades and back—for everyone involved`.

En dashes (–). Half the length of the em dash. Used between inclusive numbers, to show a range.

`The cost is $50–$55.`

`My weight has ranged from 125–165 lbs in the last decade.`

Sports scores do not indicate a range, and therefore use a hyphen.

To make an em-dash or an en-dash in Word on a PC or Mac:

- place your cursor where the mark will go
- go to “Insert” in the program menu and open up “Symbol”
- highlight the appropriate symbol
- click “insert”

Mac key codes:

em-dash: option/shift/hyphen en-dash: option/hyphen

PC key codes:

em-dash:  shift + alt + hyphen

en-dash:  “windows symbol key” + alt + hyphen

Or, create your own shortcuts by following the directions in the Symbol section.

Hyphens with prefixes and suffixes:

In general, prefixes are not followed by hyphens unless the resulting word can be confused with another word, is difficult to decipher, or precedes a number or a capitalized word.

co:  coauthor; cowriter; codirector; coedit; but co-chair

fold:  threefold

like:  no hyphen unless word ends in l. lifelike; funnel-like

mid:  midwinter; midyear; midlife; mid-Atlantic; mid-August; mid-1990s

non:  nonprofit; nonstudent; nonmajor; nonproliferation

pre:  preprofessional; premed; prelaw

Suspending hyphens:

Use when a series of hyphenated adjectives modifies the last noun in the series:

`first- and second-level courses`

`two- and three-year-old children`

Measurements:

Hyphenate measurements that serve as adjectives preceding a noun:

`The bandage is a two-inch-long strip of gauze.`
`Place this four-foot block of wood in the fire.`

Connect measurements with hyphens when the numbers represent a range, and they function as an adjective preceding a noun:

`We knew that the tsunami might create 80-to-90-foot tidal waves.`

Fractions:

Hyphenate spelled-out fractions when used as modifiers, unless the numerator or denominator is already hyphenated. Whole numbers are not linked to the fraction with hyphens.

`one-half empty; two-thirds majority`

`fifty-six hundredths; four twenty-fifths; five and three-tenths inches`

Whole numbers:

Hyphenate from 21 to 99 when spelled out:

`twenty-one; ninety-nine; one hundred forty-eight`

Sports scores:

`The game ended in a 21-21 tie. Middlebury won in double overtime, 3-2.`
