**East, east** (cap when referring to geographic location; lowercase for compass direction)

**Eastern Europe**

**e.g.** (use when you mean “for example”; roman type, followed by a comma)

**ellipsis points**

Three points, or dots, show that something has been omitted (a word, line, etc.) from the text. The points are placed on the line and are separated equally from each other and the text before and after.

For an omission in midsentence:

`He has developed many theories . . . most of them complex.`

For an omission at the end or beginning of a sentence, a period precedes the ellipsis points:

`We have tried to make peace. . . . The forces for change will negotiate sooner or later.`

Other punctuation used in the original should be retained with three ellipsis points.

`Why can’t we find this thing, . . . that he described?`

Do not use ellipses at the beginning or ending of a quotation.

Note: When possible, do not use Word’s ellipsis symbol, which does not use equal spaces. Instead, make the symbol yourself.

`#.#.#.#`  (space dot space dot space dot space)

**email**
