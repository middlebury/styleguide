**A** (when referring to a grade, no quotation marks); grades of A or As

**a cappella** (preferred spelling)

**abbreviations/acronyms**

General use guidelines:

Use full words the first time the abbreviation or acronym is used in text, and place the abbreviation or acronym in parentheses immediately following.

Do not begin a sentence with an abbreviation. Exceptions: Mr., Ms., Mrs., Dr., and St.

Some common abbreviations:

`U.S., USA, D.C., L.A.`

`PhD, BA, MA, MLitt, MD, NATO, AIDS, CEO`

`e.g., i.e., etc.`

`a.k.a.` (for “also known as”)

`AM, PM; or a.m., p.m.` (use small caps when a more formal and easier-to-read look is needed; always use a.m. and p.m. in running text)

`St. for Saint, Mt. for Mount` (spell out in more formal text; otherwise, just be consistent within a document whether using abbreviations or spelling out)

Periods with abbreviations:
- Use periods with abbreviations ending in lowercase letters: Dr., Ms., etc.
- Use periods with initials standing for a person’s name: J. R. Tolkien. Do not use periods with initials that replace the full name: JFK.
- No periods are used with abbreviations comprised of full capitals, even if lowercase letters appear within the abbreviation: PhD, MD, CEO
- In running text, spell out state names but in less formal writing periods can be used with traditional state abbreviations and the United States (U.S.); see states

Capitals vs. lowercase:

Initialisms used as nouns tend to be capped: HIV, UFO, FAQ

Over time, some longer initialisms become lowercased (radar). Refer to Webster’s when in doubt.

Abbreviations, plural:

Abbreviations without periods take _s_, no apostrophe. Apostrophes may be used if misreading is a possibility.

`BA, BAs; PhD, PhDs; URL, URLs`

Abbreviations with one period usually add the _s_ before the period:

`ed., eds.; yr., yrs.; Dr., Drs.`

Abbreviations with more than one period use apostrophe _s_:

`p.p.’s; the d.t.’s`

**acronyms** see abbreviations

**ACT** (American College Test)

**addresses**

Middlebury addresses should spell out the name of the building and the name of the department, or use the box number:

```
Joe Smith
Box 1234
Middlebury College
Middlebury, VT 05753
```

```
Jane Jones
Student Financial Services, Service Building
Middlebury College
Middlebury, VT 05753
```
When listing a classroom or office, the name of the building comes first, followed by the room number. If the words Room or Suite are added, add a comma. (It's preferable to add Room or Suite if the written piece is one going to an audience unfamiliar with the campus.)

**Annual Fund**

**Annual Giving**; Office of Annual Giving

**apostrophe** (used to indicate possessive; to show that something is missing as in part of a year: "the '60s"; or used for a contraction: "they're" for "they are.") Be especially careful when using the apostrophe with "it." Use of the apostrophe indicates a letter is missing: 

`It's raining out.` (It is raining out—the "i" is missing.)

With no apostrophe, the word indicates the possessive:

`The house lost its roof.` see also possessives

In class years and decades, the apostrophe should point to the left:

`’02, P’00, GP’89`

`’80s, ’20s`

There is no apostrophe in a range of dates:

`1985–89`

Note: According to *Chicago Manual of Style* Online Q&A: “In word-processed documents, when apostrophes are preceded by a space (as opposed to those in the middle of a word, like it’s), the software thinks the writer wants an opening quotation mark and supplies one. When documents aren’t proofread carefully, these marks appear in place of apostrophes.”

Avoid using “daggers”: A dagger is a straight, pointed character that can be used as a reference mark:

Not OK:  `'80`

OK: `’80`

Exception: Some fonts or Web programs cannot make a curly apostrophe or it is very difficult to achieve it so a dagger must be used in those instances.

How to make a left-facing apostrophe: This character is located in Microsoft Word’s “insert” menu > symbol > advanced symbol > special characters. Select the “single closing quote.” PC users, creating a shortcut is helpful if you use the character often.

Mac shortcut: `shift + option + right bracket key`
