**apostrophe** (used to indicate possessive; to show that something is missing as in part of a year: "the '60s"; or used for a contraction: "they're" for "they are.") Be especially careful when using the apostrophe with "it." Use of the apostrophe indicates a letter is missing: 

`It's raining out.` (It is raining out—the "i" is missing.)

With no apostrophe, the word indicates the possessive:

`The house lost its roof.` see also possessives

      `’02, P’00, GP’89`

      `’80s, ’20s`

      There is no apostrophe in a range of dates:

      `1985–89`

      Note: According to *Chicago Manual of Style* Online Q&A: “In word-processed documents, when apostrophes are preceded by a space (as opposed to those in the middle of a word, like it’s), the software thinks the writer wants an opening quotation mark and supplies one. When documents aren’t proofread carefully, these marks appear in place of apostrophes.”

      Avoid using “daggers”: A dagger is a straight, pointed character that can be used as a reference mark:

      Not OK:  `'80`

      OK: `’80`

Exception: Some fonts or Web programs cannot make a curly apostrophe or it is very difficult to achieve it so a dagger must be used in those instances.
