`e.g., i.e., etc.`

`a.k.a.` (for “also known as”)

`AM, PM; or a.m., p.m.` (use small caps for a more formal and easier-to-read look)

Periods with abbreviations:
- Use periods with abbreviations ending in lowercase letters: Dr., Ms., etc.
- Use periods with initials standing for a person’s name: J. R. Tolkien. Do not use periods with initials that replace the full name: JFK.
- No periods are used with abbreviations comprised of full capitals, even if lowercase letters appear within the abbreviation: PhD, MD, CEO
- In running text, use periods with traditional state abbreviations and the United States (U.S.) (see States)

General use guidelines:

Use full words the first time the abbreviation or acronym is used in text, and place the abbreviation or acronym in parentheses immediately following.

Do not begin a sentence with an abbreviation. Exceptions: Mr., Ms., Mrs., Dr., and St.

Capitals vs. lowercase:

Initialisms used as nouns tend to be capped: HIV, UFO, FAQ

Over time, some longer initialisms become lowercased (radar). Refer to Webster’s when in doubt.

Abbreviations, plural:

Abbreviations without periods take s, no apostrophe. Apostrophes may be used if misreading is a possibility.

`BA, BAs; PhD, PhDs; URL, URLs`

Abbreviations with one period usually add the s before the period:

`ed., eds.; yr., yrs.; Dr., Drs.`

Abbreviations with more than one period use apostrophe s:

`p.p.’s; the d.t.’s`

**apostrophe**

In class years and decades, the apostrophe should point to the left:

`’02, P’00, GP’89`

`’80s, ’20s`

There is no apostrophe in a range of dates:

`1985–89`

Note: According to *Chicago Manual of Style* Online Q&A: “In word-processed documents, when apostrophes are preceded by a space (as opposed to those in the middle of a word, like it’s), the software thinks the writer wants an opening quotation mark and supplies one. When documents aren’t proofread carefully, these marks appear in place of apostrophes.”

Avoid using “daggers”: A dagger is a straight, pointed character that can be used as a reference mark:

Not OK:  `'80`

OK: `’80`

How to make a left-facing apostrophe: This character is located in Microsoft Word’s “insert” menu > symbol > advanced symbol > special characters. Select the “single closing quote.” PC users, creating a shortcut is helpful if you use the character often.

Mac shortcut: `shift + option + right bracket key`
