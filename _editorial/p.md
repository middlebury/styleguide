**prepositions at the end of a sentence**

*Chicago Manual of Style*, 5.176: “The traditional caveat of yesteryear against ending sentences with prepositions is, for most writers, an unnecessary and pedantic restriction. As Winston Churchill famously said, ‘That is the type of arrant pedantry up with which I shall not put.’ A sentence that ends in a preposition may sound more natural than a sentence carefully constructed to avoid a final preposition. Compare, for example, `This is the case I told you about` with `This is the case about which I told you`. The ‘rule’ prohibiting terminal prepositions was an ill-founded superstition.”
