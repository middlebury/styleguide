**Q-and-A format** written this way in running text

**quotation marks with other punctuation**

Commas and periods go inside quotation marks:

`The name of the article is “Never Try This at Home,” and we all read it.`

`She said, “The article says you should ‘always have a fire extinguisher available.’”`

Semicolons and colons go outside if they are not part of the quoted material:

`He told her he was “testing the waters”; indeed, he jumped off the bridge.`

Question marks and exclamation points go either inside or outside, depending upon whether the quoted statement is part of the question or exclamation:

`“I shall overcome!” he shouted.`

`Did he say, “I will balance the budget”?`

**quotes** see capitalization
