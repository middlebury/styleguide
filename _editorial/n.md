**Nordic skiing**

**North**; north (cap when referring to geographic location; lowercase for compass direction)

**numbers**

Never start a sentence with a numeral. Spell out the number:

`One hundred and thirty-five people attended the conference.`

Avoid starting a phrase or sentence after an em-dash or colon with a numeral. Spell out the number or rewrite:

`They made a lot of money—thirty-six people gave millions.`

`They made a lot of money because 36 people gave millions.`

In general:

- Spell out numbers one to nine in text. (Exception: Use 5th reunion for consistency with every other reunion year.)
- Use numerals for 10 and higher.
- Thousands take a comma: 2,450 not 2450.

Large, round, even numbers used as approximations can be spelled out:

`The history spans some four thousand years of Western civilization.`

Very large numbers (million and higher) may be expressed with a combination of numerals and spelled-out numbers.

`2 million people; 10 trillion is a large number`

These same rules apply to ordinals:

`seventh place; 30th position; 135th award; third in line`

Clusters of Numbers:

Numbers within a sentence or paragraph that cluster together and are used in the same context should maintain consistency. If one of the numbers would normally be written as a numeral, use numerals for all in that same category. It is fine to have one category written with numerals and another with numbers spelled out:

`There are 14 graduates, 25 alumni, 3 first-year students, and 1 senior in the program.`

`Middlebury faculty published 20 books in 2010; 5 were on the bestseller list, and they will be publishing 7 books next month.`

`When mother came, we found seven dead pigeons outside. That didn’t deter us from enjoying our snack. She served 5 kinds of cookies, 11 new beers, and 7 types of goat cheese.`

Decimals:

Use numerals, even in text:

`We are expecting to harvest 5.4 tons of corn.`

Fractions:

Simple fractions: Spell out in text. Hyphenate the fraction if it represents a single quantity or when used as a modifier.

`five-sixths of the population`

`He received two-thirds majority`

But: `I’m dividing my estate into five fifths to distribute to my heirs.`

`Five-sevenths full`

Whole numbers plus fractions: These can be spelled or expressed in numerals, whichever is most readable. (Do not link whole numbers to the fraction with a hyphen)

`Three and three-fourths cups of flour should be enough to make pizza.`

`The recipe calls for 3 ¾ cups of flour.`

Measurements:

Hyphenate measurements that serve as adjectives preceding a noun:

`The bandage is a two-inch-long strip of gauze.`

`Place this four-foot block of wood in the fireplace.`

Connect measurements with hyphens when the numbers represent a range, and they function as an adjective preceding a noun:

`We knew that a tsunami might create 80-to-90-foot tidal waves.`

[See also hyphens](#)

Money:

References to money may be written as numerals or spelled out. If spelled, also spell the unit of currency, except when using very large numbers.

`fifty cents; six dollars; seventy-five euro`

`$.50; $125`

`$1 million; $10.3 billion`

Percentages:

Always express percentages as a numeral-word combination, except in charts and scientific copy: `25 percent, 4 percent`

Reunion Years:

Use numerals for specific reunions: `20th reunion, 10th reunion`

Reunion events may be expressed this way: `Reunion 2012, Reunion Weekend`

Temperature:

`45 degrees F` (no period after the F within a sentence)

`45°F` (no spaces)
