### vertical lists

When possible, introduce the list with a complete grammatical sentence followed by a colon. Avoid putting a colon in the middle of a sentence, as after the word include.

In general: Try to use parallel syntax (sentences, fragments, questions) with each item, which will make the list orderly and more understandable. _Chicago Manual of Style Online_ cautions that “parallel doesn’t mean identical. If your items are complex, it may not be practical to match them word for word with parallel parts of speech.”

_styling vertical lists_

Vertical lists can by styled in many ways, as unmarked lists, as numbered or bulleted lists, in paragraph style with internal punctuation, as a sentence, and with subdivided items. Be consistent throughout a document with uppercase and lowercase elements and in the use of punctuation.

unmarked list:


We hope you will bring these items to our open house:
lawnmower
snow blower
leaf rake
new plantings for along driveway


numbered list: (items may be capitalized or lowercased)

We hope you will bring these items to our open house:

1. Lawnmower
2. Snow blower
3. Leaf rake
4. New plantings for along driveway

paragraph style:

When you come to our open house, we hope you will consider these facts: (1) Since the house is big, we will need some way to manage the large amount of trash that will be generated; (2) Our building has been in disrepair for several years; (3) The previous owner absconded with our deposit; and (4) we are not happy with its overall appearance.

sentence style: (first element may be capped or lowercased)


  We hope you will bring these items to our open house:

  - several leaf rakes to allow for easy removal of old compost,
  - one light wheelbarrow that is easy to push,
  - some good music to work to, and
  - a sense of play, so that you can stay all day.

  2. Food items

    - Hot dogs
    - Ice
  3. Musical items
    - Instruments
    - iPods

Use of periods in vertical lists:

In general, follow the examples above. When a list contains a combination of sentence fragments and full sentences, try to revise so they are all similar. If that is not possible, use periods after all items for visual consistency.

**vice-chairman**

**vice president** (no hyphen) 

**videotape**; **video recorder**

### voice

Write in the active voice, as simply as possible.

Active, not convoluted: `The College educates students to become advocates for change.`

Passive, convoluted: `Students are educated by the College to develop an awareness of their obligation to become advocates for change.`
