**C** (when referring to a grade, no quotation marks); grades of C or Cs 

**café**, also cafe

**campuswide** (no hyphen with suffix –wide unless the word is capped: collegewide, statewide, worldwide but College-wide for undergraduate, Institute-wide for Monterey) see suffixes

**capitalization** (Capitalize only formal or specific names. When in doubt, use lowercase, especially when a word’s meaning is generic.)
See **titles** for rules about professional and academic titles.

Names, associations, conferences, and official policies:

As a rule, official names are capitalized. Unofficial or shortened names are not. This applies to offices, buildings, and programs, as well as to committees and boards, symposia, conferences, course titles, forms, applications, and so on. For example, the Board of Trustees is shortened to the board. The Residential Life Committee becomes the committee. The Middlebury College Museum of Art—the museum; the Common Application for Admission—admission application; Language Schools—the schools.

Exceptions: Exceptions may sometimes be made to avoid confusion or because the shortened, generic term has become a proper name in its own right:References to Middlebury’s undergraduate school, when shortened, are capped—College; Middlebury Institute of International Studies when shortened is the Institute.

Names of departments are always capped: The Department of French; the French Department.

Names of official policies, such as Institutional Diversity and Undergraduate Honor System, should be capitalized. However, when the concept is being discussed, use the lowercase. 
`Middlebury College is strongly committed to promoting diversity on campus.` 
`A strict honor system is enforced at the College.`

In running text, lowercase a *the* that precedes a name, even if it is part of the official name:

`The Underhill Foundation`

`When you visit the Underhill Foundation, please check their address.`

Grades:

Capitalize the letters used for grades and grade names. Do not place quotation marks around grades.

`A, B, C, D, F, Pass, Incomplete; Grade of B; Grades of B or Bs`

Headlines: 

capitalize

1. The first and last word, no matter what part of speech they are.
2. The first word after a colon, no matter what part of speech it is.

lowercase

1. Articles (`a, an, the`).
2. Coordinating conjunctions (`and, but, or, for, nor`).
3. All prepositions (`through, on, in, to,`) except when they are used adverbially (Look Up) or adjectivally (the On Button) or when part of a Latin expression used adjectivally (In Vitro).
4. The *to* in infinitives.
5. Part of proper names that would normally be lowercased, ex. *van* or *de*.
6. The second part of a species name (*Homo sapiens*).

Headline examples:

`What I’ve Been Thinking Of`

`Peter van Dyke’s Drive through the Countryside`

`Helping Homo sapiens to Survive`

`The Science of In Vitro Fertilization Form`

Headlines with hyphenated words: Cap both elements. The only exception is if the subsequent element is an article (`a, an, the`), coordinating conjunction (`and, but, or, for, nor`), preposition (`through, on, in, to, etc.`)—or the modifiers flat, sharp, and natural.

`Self-Sustaining Economics`

`F-sharp Concerto`

`Concerto in F-Sharp`

`Full-Time Jobs`

`Twenty-Fifth Street Headquarters`

Headlines with a prefix: This is basically one word, not two, so the second element is not capped unless it is a proper noun or proper adjective.

`Anti-intellectual Attitudes on the Increase`

`The Insensitive Chaos of Objects: Pier Paolo Pasolini, Paleo-aesthetics, and Arte Povera`

`Non-Christian Organization Donates Books`

Holidays and Recurring Events:

Capitalize holidays, ceremonies, and recurring observances and weekends:

`Winter Carnival; Thanksgiving; Commencement; Baccalaureate; Convocation; Midyear Celebration; Fall Family Weekend; Homecoming; Reunion Weekend`

Do not capitalize seasons, academic periods, or breaks:

`winter term; fall admission; summer break`

Original Quotes:

When quoting original material, use the capitalization system of the original, even if it does not conform to Middlebury style.

`As the soldier explained 100 years ago, “We have forgiven Men and Little`

`Children who did not know what to expect from our Party.”`

Exception: When a quote is used as an integral part of a sentence, the initial cap in the original may be dropped.

`He still believes that “we have forgiven Men and Little Children.”`

Plurals with generic terms:

When a generic term is part of a proper noun, it is capped: Proctor Dining Hall. When two names are used in conjunction, followed by the generic term, it is still capped: Proctor and Ross Dining Halls; Hudson and East Rivers; Bread Loaf and Worth Mountains. By capping the generic term, it is unambiguous that it is part of each proper noun.

**class, Class of 2013** (cap for specific classes)

**class years** see also degree abbreviations

In Middlebury publications, always mention the alum’s class year in the first reference.

Present century:

`Class of 2009`

`Suzanne Lunde, Class of 2009`

`Suzanne Lunde ’09`

Note: The apostrophe points to the left.

1900s:

Classes from previous centuries that duplicate numerals of classes in the present century should be written in full.

`John Smith, Class of 1906`

John Smith Jr. ’60 (referring to 1960)

John Smith III ’06 (referring to 2006)

1800s:

`John Smith, Class of 1855`

Febs:

Try to avoid using the .5 designation because it is very difficult to verify in Banner, does not necessarily mean anything to older alumni or non-Middlebury readers, and becomes cumbersome. Febs choose whether to be affiliated with the class that graduated before or after them, and this is generally reflected in Banner.

`Marcia Long (graduated in February 2011) may choose either Marcia Long ’10 or Marcia Long ’11.`

Exception: On those rare occasions when individuals insist on the .5 designation and supply the information themselves: `Marcia Long ’10.5`

For combinations of names, class years, and degrees, see degree abbreviations


**co words** (close most co words) coauthor, cocurricular, coexistence, cohead

**co-chair**

**collective nouns**

Collective nouns related to quantity (percentage and fractions—_thirty percent, one-fourth, half_) take a singular verb when preceded by *the*. Otherwise, the verb agrees with the number of the noun in the prepositional phrase that follows it:

`After receiving their pink slips this week, the third of employees with stock options has decided to cash in company stocks.`

But:

`Fortunately, four fifths of the employees have stocks to cash in.` (plural noun in prepositional phrase)

`Unfortunately, four fifths of last year’s harvest was lost.` (singular noun in prep phrase)


“Number of” as a collective noun:

Whether it takes a singular or plural verb depends on which article precedes it: definite *the* or indefinite *a*.

`The number of trees planted this year has doubled.`

But:

`A number of experts have demonstrated that planting trees in the fall improves their viability.`

One of:

“One of” takes a singular verb because it refers to one

`One of those men fixes cars every day.`

One of those who:

“One of those who” takes a plural verb because the verb refers to “those”

`One of those men who fix cars will work on your new project.`

**College** (when referring to Middlebury’s undergraduate school only)

**College Advancement** (See Office of Advancement)

**college archives**, or archives—one of four discrete collections in Special Collections

**College breaks** (see **breaks**)

**College-wide** (when –wide is added to capped words, use the hyphen)

**colon**

Colons introduce material that amplifies the preceding statement or elements. The element following the colon begins with a capital letter if it is more than one sentence long, a formal statement, or a quotation.

`We found this to be extraordinary: young people are very enthusiastic about our study.`

`The study revealed an unexpected result: Sleep-deprived people are more effective at driving with their eyes closed. Well-rested people are more cheerful.`

Do not place a colon in the middle of a sentence, between the verb and object or between a preposition and object.

Wrong: `You will need: your best attitude and a good night’s sleep.`

Correct: `You will need your best attitude and a good night’s sleep.`

Wrong: `We will be traveling to: New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.`

Correct: `We will be traveling to New York, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.`

Place a colon after the salutation in a business letter or address:

`Alumni and Friends:`

Use to introduce a list or series but not if it comes in the middle of a sentence:

Correct: `Please include the following items in your suitcase: socks, ties, and underwear.`

Wrong:

```
The topics being discussed include:
	Winter term classes
	First-year seminars
	Reading assignments
```

**comma**

Commas should be used to make text more clear and understandable, but they tend to be overused. Rule of thumb: when in doubt, leave it out!

Adjective string:

In general, if two or more adjectives preceding a noun can be joined with “and,” separate them with commas, unless the noun and adjective are considered to be a unit, e.g., “bad boy.” Use judgment. Too many commas can make writing choppy.

`She made a donation to a new political organization.`

`It will be a frigid, expensive winter.`

City, state:

After city and after state in running text:

`The College is located in Middlebury, Vermont, near Lake Champlain.`

Compound sentence:

To separate two sentences connected with a coordinating conjunction, _and, but, or_—two subjects, two verbs that could be made into two sentences.

Correct: `The professor is highly talented, and he will surprise you with his ideas.`

Correct: `Johnson is highly talented, but Truman isn’t.`

Wrong: `Jones went home, and unlocked the doors. (Just one subject, no comma needed)`

Note: In general no comma is used in the “not only but also” sequence unless the sentence is long and relatively complicated and needs a comma to break it up.

`She not only loves peanut butter but also jelly.`

Dates:

Before and after the year, in full dates within sentences:

`The president was born on August 9, 1950, in a New York checker cab.`

Between day and year in full dates but not between a month and year: `May 1, 2002`

`May 2015`

Introductory elements:

Use comma after introductory elements that can be eliminated without changing the meaning of the main clause:

`By the time you get this message, you will probably have forgotten our conversation.`

`If you agree with our decision, please sign and return the contract.`

It is not necessary to use the comma after short introductory elements, unless needed for clarity:

`Before lunch we usually work out.`

Series:

Use comma to separate each item in a series, including the last item:

`He brought bread, potatoes, green beans, and butterscotch.`

However, do not use a comma if “and” is replaced by an ampersand:

`He teaches biology, chemistry & law.` (Avoid this use of ampersand if possible.)

**compound nouns and adjectives**

Two words used as one expression may be written as one word, as a hyphenated word, or as two separate words. Which form to use often depends upon the use or position in the sentence.

`We arrived at the football field at halftime.` (noun)

`This ad says it is a half-time position.` (adjective before noun)

`He lives in the first-floor apartment.` (adjective before noun)

`His apartment is on the first floor.` (follows noun)

To hyphenate or not to hyphenate is often a question for writers and editors. Use hyphens to increase readability. For example, the hyphen in much-needed clothing shows that the clothing is greatly needed rather than abundant and needed. Where no ambiguity could result, hyphenation is not needed.

`High school student; experiential learning opportunities; winter term courses`

When in doubt about whether to hyphenate, check the dictionary. Also, see the _Chicago Manual of Style_ hyphenation guide, pages 375–384.

**conjunctions**

Conjunctions such as _and, or, but_, and _nor_ may be used to begin a sentence. However, doing so should not be a substitute for clear writing.

**Convocation**

**cooperative**

**course work**

**cross-country skiing; cross-country running**

**cum laude** (roman type, no italics)

**cultural periods**

Some are lowercased; some are capitalized. Refer to _Chicago Manual of Style_ or the dictionary.
