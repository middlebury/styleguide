**D** (when referring to a grade, no quotation marks); grades of D or Ds

**Dance Company of Middlebury** (DCM)

**dashes**; en and em dashes, see hyphens

**data** (used as a plural noun, i.e. “earnings,” or a singular “mass noun,” i.e. “information”)

**database**

**dates**

At Middlebury, we express dates this way: month/day/year

`March 16, 1998`

`The meeting is on March 7 (not: March 7th, 7 March).`

`We will see you on the 13th of July.`

`October 7–17, 2011; October 7–November 5, 2011`

`Tickets are on sale, Wednesday, June 5, at the concert hall.`

Note: See hyphens for more on en-dash use: An en dash is longer than a hyphen and is used between inclusive numbers, to show a range.

In a sentence, separate the day and year with commas:

`The president was born on August 9, 1950, in a New York checker cab.`

No comma is used when the month and year appear without a day: 

`The weather pattern changed in October 1998 for the better.`

**David W. Ginevan Recycling Center**; Recycling Center

**Davis Family Library** See Named Buildings for guidelines on how to refer to this building

**Davis Fellows**; Kathryn Davis Fellows for Peace; fellow

**D.C.** (in informal writing, such as class notes, an acceptable abbreviation for Washington, D.C.)

**dean** (lowercase except when using it in a title before a name) see titles

**Dean’s List**

**dean of the College**

**dean of curriculum**

**dean of the faculty**; the dean’s office

**dean of planning and assessment**

**decades**

Spell out centuries, using the same numeral rules (spell anything lower than 10).

`fourth-century art`

`life in the 19th century`

`21st-century liberal arts education`

Several options for identifying decades may be used:

`1980s, 1960s; ’60s, ’80s; eighties, sixties`

Note: no apostrophe between the year and s

**degree abbreviations** see also class years

Graduate schools and advanced degrees:

```
Betty Smith, MA French ’90
Thomas Horn, MA English ’02
Harry Jenkins, MLitt English ’77
Clint Underwood, MA Spanish ’55
```

Exception: If a degree is being listed in a publication solely aimed at the audience of one particular school, like Bread Loaf, only put the MA with no comma.

```
Thomas Horn MA’02
```

Institute alumni:

```
Betty Smith BAIS ’10
Peter Lang MAIPS ’12
Lucinda Lander MATESOL ’12
John Jones MBA ’08
```

Honorary degrees:

```
Mark Thane, Hon DArt ’10
James Caldwell, Hon DHL ’01

```

Combinations of names and degrees:
Rule of thumb: Place spaces and commas between each of the elements. Use maiden names for married alumnae.

Parents and grandparents:
```
Jennifer Jenkins P’05
Beulah Rockford P’77, ’80, GP’09
```

Combinations of degrees:

Sequence: undergraduate, graduate, honorary
```
Lucille Hentz Taft ’82, MA French ’85
Sylvester Sinclair ’10, MAIPS ’13
Clark Simpson ’47, MLitt English ’61, Hon DArt ’92
```

Combinations of degrees and relationships:

Sequence: undergraduate, graduate, honorary, parent, grandparent

```
Jennifer Lee ’85, MA Russian ’94, P’14
Frederick Favre ’51, MA Italian ’60, P’80, ’81, GP’10
Lucy Pope Lyons ’63, MA French ’65, Hon DHL ’72, P’89, GP’17
```

Combinations of people:

Rule of thumb: The alum is always listed first; if both people are alums, the man is listed first so woman’s maiden name can be included; otherwise the woman is listed first if neither person is an alum and the maiden name is not needed.

```
Susan James Johnston ’98 and Paul Johnston
Eric ’69 and Louise Ames Hollander ’71
Henry Lappman ’90 and Nicole Sweet ’91
Mary and Joseph Clark
Norma Sampson and William Larch
```

Note: If both people are the parents of the student, the parent designation goes after the second name, preceded by a comma. If only one person is the parent, that person is listed first regardless of whether it is the man or the woman.

```
Cindy and James Clough, P’10
Helen Peterson P’09 and John Henderson
Lars Olsen P’17 and Cynthia Olsen
```

Note: Depending on the formality of the publication, names can be shortened or spelled out and middle initials can be added for more formal pieces.

On name tags:

For the small area on name tags, it’s fine to amend these rules to fit the space. For example, Jeremiah Long P’80, ’90, GP’07 could be changed to `Jeremiah Long P’80’90G’07`.

On invitations/talks/programs:

Any of the designations above may be used on invitations. The class year and degree may be spelled out for more formal treatments.

**departments** (cap departments)

`Department of Physics; Physics Department; Department of French; French Department`

**Digital Liberal Arts Initiative** (DLA)

**directions** (lowercase north, south, east, west, northern, etc., when they indicate a compass direction: `They traveled west. She moved back east.` Cap these words when they designate a region: `They love the West Coast. She lives in Northern Virginia.`)

**disability-related terms**

General note: Only refer to a disability when it's truly relevant to the story. When unsure, ask the person or people directly involved.

General terminology: 

Avoid describing a group only by their disabilities. Humanizing phrases acknowledge that disability is a relevant adjective.

Less appropriate `the disabled, the blind, the paraplegic, the deaf, the handicapped`  
More appropriate `disabled persons, people with disabilities, deaf people, blind citizens, persons with developmental disabilities`

Avoid using "special" and "special needs" language. Disabled people's needs are not special nor are they inherently needy.

Less appropriate `There are alternate formats, such as audio files, for those with special needs.`  
More appropriate `Alternate formats, such as audio files, are available.`

Avoid stigmatizing language.

Less appropriate `handicapped parking`  
More appropriate `accessible parking`

Less appropriate `normal people` (suggesting disabled people are not normal)  
More appropriate `nondisabled, typical, not living with a disability` (when used in text that includes both disabled and nondisabled persons)

Less appropriate `afflicted with, stricken with, suffers from, victim of`  
More appropriate `a person who is blind, a person who has PTSD` (language that is more neutral and states the nature of the disability)

Less appropriate `wheelchair bound, confined to a wheelchair`  
More appropriate `wheelchair user, person who uses a wheelchair`

**Donald E. Axinn ’51, Litt. D. ’89 Center for Literary and Cultural Studies at Starr Library**; Axinn Center at Starr Library (Note: the use of “Litt. D.” here is an exception to our style because that is how the building was named.)
