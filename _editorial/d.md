**D** (when referring to a grade, no quotation marks); grades of D or Ds

**data** (used as a plural noun, i.e. “earnings,” or a singular “mass noun,” i.e. “information”)

**database**

**dates**

At Middlebury, we express dates this way: month/day/year

`March 16, 1998`

`The meeting is on March 7 (not: March 7th, 7 March).`

`We will see you on the 13th of July.`

`October 7–17, 2011; October 7–November 5, 2011`

`Tickets are on sale, Wednesday, June 5, at the concert hall.`

Note: See hyphens and dashes for more on en-dash use: An en dash is longer than a hyphen and is used between inclusive numbers, to show a range.

In a sentence, separate the day and year with commas:

`The president was born on August 9, 1950, in a New York checker cab.`

No comma is used when the month and year appear without a day: 

`The weather pattern changed in October 1998 for the better.`

**Davis Family Library**

**Davis Fellows**; Kathryn Davis Fellows for Peace

**D.C.** (in informal writing, such as class notes, an acceptable abbreviation for Washington, D.C.)

**Dean’s List**

**dean of the College**

**dean of curriculum**

**dean of the faculty**; the dean’s office

**dean of planning and assessment**

**decades**

Spell out centuries, using the same numeral rules (spell anything lower than 10).

`fourth-century art`

`life in the 19th century`

`21st-century liberal arts education`

Several options for identifying decades may be used:

`1980s, 1960s; ’60s, ’80s; eighties, sixties`

Note: no apostrophe between the year and s
