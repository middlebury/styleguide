**database**

**dates**

At Middlebury, we express dates this way: month/day/year

`March 16, 1998`

`The meeting is on March 7 (not: March 7th, 7 March).`

`We will see you on the 13th of July.`

`October 7–17, 2011; October 7–November 5, 2011`

`Tickets are on sale, Wednesday, June 5, at the concert hall.`

Note: See hyphens and dashes for more on en-dash use: An en dash is longer than a hyphen and is used between inclusive numbers, to show a range.

In a sentence, separate the day and year with commas:

`The president was born on August 9, 1950, in a New York checker cab.`

No comma is used when the month and year appear without a day: 

`The weather pattern changed in October 1998 for the better.`

**dean of the College**

**dean of curriculum**

**dean of planning and assessment**

**decades**

Spell out centuries, using the same numeral rules (spell anything lower than 10).

`life in the 19th century`

`21st-century liberal arts education`

Several options for identifying decades may be used:

`1980s, 1960s; ’60s, ’80s; eighties, sixties`

Note: no apostrophe between the year and s

**disability-related terms**

General note: Only refer to a disability when it's truly relevant to the story. When unsure, ask the person or people directly involved.

General terminology: 

Avoid describing a group only by their disabilities. Humanizing phrases acknowledge that disability is a relevant adjective.
Less appropriate `the disabled, the blind, the paraplegic, the deaf, the handicapped`
More appropriate `disabled persons, people with disabilities, deaf people, blind citizens, persons with developmental disabilities`

Avoid using "special" and "special needs" language. Disabled people's needs are not special nor are they inherently needy.
Less appropriate `There are alternate formats, such as audio files, for those with special needs.`
More appropriate `Alternate formats, such as audio files, are available.`

Avoid stigmatizing language.
Less appropriate `handicapped parking`
More appropriate `accessible parking`

Less appropriate `normal people` (suggesting disabled people are not normal)
More appropriate `nondisabled, typical, not living with a disability` (when used in text that includes both disabled and nondisabled persons)

Less appropriate `afflicted with, stricken with, suffers from, victim of`
More appropriate `a person who is blind, a person who has PTSD` (language that is more neutral and states the nature of the disability)

Less appropriate `wheelchair bound, confined to a wheelchair`
More appropriate `wheelchair user, person who uses a wheelchair`

**Donald E. Axinn ’51, Litt. D. ’89 Center for Literary and Cultural Studies at Starr Library**; Axinn Center at Starr Library (Note: the use of “Litt. D.” here is an exception to our style because that is how the building was named.)
