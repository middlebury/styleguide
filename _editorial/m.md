**mass nouns** 
A mass noun is one that denotes something uncountable, either because it is abstract (evidence) or because it refers to an indeterminate aggregation of people or things (faculty, staff). The latter is also called a collective noun. As the subject of a sentence, a mass noun usually takes a singular verb. (The evidence is irrefutable.) But in a collective sense, it may take either a singular or plural verb form, depending on whether the group is being described or the individual members.
