**SAT** (Scholastic Aptitude Test)

**scholar-athlete**

**School of Japanese** (Language Schools)

**School of Spanish** (Language Schools)

**schoolwide**; see suffixes

**seasons/semesters** see capitalization

Do not capitalize fall, winter, spring, or summer unless part of a title.

**self- words**; words using self- as a prefix are hyphenated (self-aware, self-evaluation, self-propelled) see prefixes

**semi- words**; most words using semi- as a prefix are closed unless the stem word begins with an "i" (semiformal, semiprofessional, semiretired, but semi-independent; see prefixes

**semicolons**

Use semicolons to separate independent clauses not joined by a conjunction:

`The weather is gloomy; we are all very depressed.`  (This can also be expressed as two sentences.)

May be used between clauses in a long compound sentence, even when they are joined by a conjunction, especially if the clauses contain several commas.

`The university has won so many awards in these fields that students are on waiting lists for applications, begging for interviews, and trying to bribe the admissions officers for special consideration; but the admissions procedures are not changing as a result of this newfound fame.`

To separate clauses linked with the following adverbs: *then*, *however*, *thus*, *hence*, *indeed*, *accordingly*, *besides*, and *therefore*:

`The Nobel Prize winners are most pleased; indeed, they are planning a huge celebration. The geologist discovered a new mineral; therefore, she is naming it after herself.`

To separate items in a series that is long and cumbersome or that contains internal commas:

`The students should take one course in math; three in languages; two chosen from political science, history, or art; and one senior capstone course.`

**semiretired**

**sentence fragments**

When incomplete sentences are used as captions, pull quotes, and subheads, a period is not needed. When sentence fragments are interspersed with full sentences, periods may be necessary for visual clarity and consistency. This might be the case in a vertical list. Be sure to be consistent within a document, whatever you decide to do.

**signs** (how to treat text) see titles

**Snow Bowl**; Middlebury College Snow Bowl

**social houses**

**socioeconomic**

**South**; south (cap when referring to a geographic location; lowercase for compass direction) see directions

**spacing**

Place one space between initials in a name. (T. H. Smith)

Exception: no spaces between the initials of C.V. Starr

There are no spaces or periods with initials that serve as proper names, such as LBJ, JFK, AAA.

Always single space between sentences. (Using double spaces is a holdover from the days of typewriters.)

**Spanish School**; see School of Spanish or Language Schools; this school should not be called the Spanish School

**Special Collections**

- Abernethy Collection of American Literature
 
- College Archives
 
- Rare Books and Manuscripts (RBMS)

**special interest houses** (also called academic interest houses)

**split infinitives**

Definition: The insertion of a word or phrase between “to” and the verb. 

`to madly love; to deliberately lie`

Not a split infinitive:

`to be always prepared`

`to be constantly searching`

Split infinitives are no longer considered to be an egregious error; in fact, sometimes the split infinitive is the only way something can be expressed. If a split infinitive can be avoided by placing the modifier elsewhere without detracting from the impact or readability of the sentence, that is preferable.

**spring**; spring break; spring semester; spring semester course; see seasons

**staff** see mass nouns

staff is, staff are, staff members (all okay, depends on context),

`Our staff is among the most experienced in the nation.`

`Middlebury staff are busy cleaning up after the largest reunion ever.`
