**SAT** (Scholastic Aptitude Test)

**scholar-athlete**

**schoolwide**

**seasons/semesters**

Do not capitalize fall, winter, spring, or summer unless part of a title.

**semi-colons**

Use semicolons to separate independent clauses not joined by a conjunction:

`The weather is gloomy; we are all very depressed.`  (This can also be expressed as two sentences.)

May be used between clauses in a long compound sentence, even when they are joined by a conjunction, especially if the clauses contain several commas.

`The university has won so many awards in these fields that students are on waiting lists for applications, begging for interviews, and trying to bribe the admissions officers for special consideration; but the admissions procedures are not changing as a result of this newfound fame.`

To separate clauses linked with the following adverbs: *then*, *however*, *thus*, *hence*, *indeed*, *accordingly*, *besides*, and *therefore*:

`The Nobel Prize winners are most pleased; indeed, they are planning a huge celebration. The geologist discovered a new mineral; therefore, she is naming it after herself.`

To separate items in a series that is long and cumbersome or that contains internal commas:

`The students should take one course in math; three in languages; two chosen from political science, history, or art; and one senior capstone course.`

**semiretired**

**sentence fragments**

When incomplete sentences are used as captions, pull quotes, and subheads, a period is
not needed. When sentence fragments are interspersed with full sentences, periods may be necessary for visual clarity and consistency. This might be the case in a vertical list. Be sure to be consistent within a document, whatever you decide to do.

**Snow Bowl**

**spacing**

Place one space between initials in a name. (T. H. Smith)

Exception: no spaces between the initials of C.V. Starr

There are no spaces or periods with initials that serve as proper names, such as LBJ, JFK, AAA.

Always single space between sentences. (Using double spaces is a holdover from the days of typewriters.)

**Special Collections**

**social houses**

**socioeconomic**

**South**; south (cap when referring to a geographic location; lowercase for compass direction)

**Spanish School** (Language Schools)

**special interest houses** (also called academic interest houses)

**split infinitives**

Definition: The insertion of a word or phrase between “to” and the verb. 

`to madly love; to deliberately lie`

Not a split infinitive:

`to be always prepared`

`to be constantly searching`

Split infinitives are no longer considered to be an egregious error; in fact, sometimes the split infinitive is the only way something can be expressed. If a split infinitive can be avoided by placing the modifier elsewhere without detracting from the impact or readability of the sentence, that is preferable.

**spring**; spring break; spring semester; spring semester course

**staff**

staff is, staff are, staff members (all okay, depends on context),

`Our staff is among the most experienced in the nation.`

`Middlebury staff are busy cleaning up after the largest reunion ever.`

`Several of our staff members are planning to submit their ideas individually.`

**Standing Committees** (Board of Trustees)

- New Programs Committee
- Prudential Committee
- Resources Committee
- Risk Management Committee
- Strategy Committee
- Trusteeship and Governance Committee

**states**

`Vermont State`, `the state of Vermont`

Spell out the full state name in running text. `She lives in Wisconsin.`

Two-letter postal codes may be used in some informal lists and must always be used when a zip code follows. Use for addresses on invitations.

Use the abbreviations listed below (first abbreviation listed) when a state name is preceded by the name of a city, town, village, or military base. Set off the state name in commas: He moved to Goshen, N.Y., after graduating from college. Do not abbreviate Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Ohio, Texas, or Utah. Use the ZIP code abbreviation for mailing addresses.
