**technology terms**

Try to avoid obscure technology references and long URLs. (You can use bitly.com to shrink long Web addresses. Or you can direct readers to the right page: `Visit www.williams.edu, click on “Alumni,” and then “Golf Tournament.”`) For websites, do not include the tag `http://`. Instead: `www.williams.edu`; `facebook.com`. When available, use a "go" link. 
If you are printing a document with a URL or email address in it, be sure to remove the hyperlink.

Common technology terms:

- CD (for music or file storage)
- database
- dot-com
- DVD
- download
- email (unless it begins a sentence, then Email is acceptable)
- home page
- Internet (acceptable for Web and World Wide Web)
- list server
- motherboard
- online
- Web (acceptable for World Wide Web and Internet)
- webmaster
- website

**telephone numbers**

Use hyphens instead of dots or parentheses. In most cases, omit the 1 that precedes the area code.

`802-443-2100`

Any phone number involving extra digits or unusual number sequences (such as overseas numbers) should provide every digit the caller needs in order to place the call. Example, a call to Darwin, Australia:

|---|---|
|---|---|
|011|International prefix used to dial outside of USA|
|61|International country code used to dial to Australia|
|8|Local area or city code used to dial to Darwin|
|LN|The local number|
|011-61-8-|local number|

**The Orchard**; the Orchard (in running text)

**theater** (for all uses except for proper names using alternate spelling)

**theatre** (This is the second spelling in Webster’s and a Middlebury department/ major);

Department of Theatre; Hepburn Zoo Theatre; Wright Memorial Theatre; _but_ Burgess Meredith Little Theater (Bread Loaf); Town Hall Theater (downtown Middlebury)

**they/their/them**

There may be times when *they*, *their*, or *them* is a necessary choice as a pronoun for a singular noun of nonspecific gender. This is most likely to occur after *nobody*, *everybody*, *one*, *anyone*, or nouns that may be either singular or plural, depending upon their usage—faculty or student body, for example. When possible, rewrite the sentence.

The use of *he/she* or *him/her*, although more grammatically accurate in these cases, is a distraction.

`Anyone can take their medicine when it tastes like strawberry shortcake.` (okay, but not great)

`Anyone can take his or her medicine when it tastes like strawberry shortcake.` (distracting)

`Most people can take their medicine when it tastes like strawberry shortcake.` (rewritten)

`The faculty decided to take its resolution to the administration.` (singular sense)

`The faculty are very pleased with their new students this year.` (plural sense, all members of the faculty)

`The members of the faculty are very pleased with their new students.` (rewritten)

`We try to let each student take his or her exam home.` (distracting)

`We try to let students in this situation take their exams home.` (rewritten)

See use of they/their in gender neutral language under [gender](#).

**time**

All of the following are acceptable—consistency is key; don’t vary the format within the same document or story:

Use numerals with AM and PM, and words with o’clock:

`5 AM; five o’clock`

Use small caps, or lowercased letters with periods:

`AM; PM`

`a.m.; p.m.`

Use numerals when the exact moment is important: The train departs at 2:08 PM.

Other uses:

`9:00 PM; 9 PM`

`noon; midnight`

Note: There is no such thing as 12:00 a.m. or 12:00 p.m. because a.m. begins immediately after midnight and p.m. begins immediately after noon.

Showing ranges:

`9:30 AM–10:30 PM, or  9:30 AM to 10:30 PM`

`from 9 AM to noon`  (do not use a dash to show range when also using “from”)

What are small caps? They are capital letters about three-quarters smaller than regular caps. Choose them from the font menu in Microsoft Word or from Word’s formatting palette.


**titles of people**

Academic and Professional:

Capitalize the title when it precedes the name and is part of the name:

`I would like to introduce Doctor John Smith.`

`President Laurie Patton will be addressing the audience.`

`We traveled with Professor Bill Johnson.`

Do not capitalize when the title follows the name (almost always a descriptor):

`John Smith, professor of biology`

`Barack Obama, president of the United States`

`Trustee Emerita Suzanne Simpson; Suzanne Simpson, trustee emerita; the trustee`  
`Professor John Jones; the professor; John Jones, professor emeritus; Professor Emeritus John Jones`

Do not capitalize when the title precedes the name, but is acting as a descriptive title: 

`Renowned geology professor Andrea Lane will deliver the keynote address.`

`Happily, designer Randy Russet made the costumes.`

`Meet our bass player Lucinda J. Horvick ’05.`

Do capitalize a title before a name if it is the official descriptor:

`I’d like you to meet Vice President for Academic Affairs John Wiley.`

`She is taking a course with Assistant Professor of Geology Matthew Rock.`

`They sent the student to Dean of the College Polly Johnson.`

Avoid using a long title before a name. Rewrite the sentence so the title falls after the name.

Awkward: `The talk was given by Dean of Institutional Diversity and Associate Professor of English and American Literatures Stephanie Wilkerson.`

Preferred: `The talk was given by Stephanie Wilkerson, dean of institutional diversity and associate professor of English and American literatures.`

NOTE: A named professorship is always capitalized, no matter where it falls

`William Wilson, John M. Martin Professor of Physics, will be there.`

`John M. Martin Professor of Physics William Wilson will be there.`

In vertical lists:

For the sake of appearance and consistency, it is permissible to cap all titles and departments in vertical lists, appearing in program notes, president reports, etc.

```
Mary Smith, Professor of Geology
Fred Dartmouth, Milton Johnson Distinguished Professor of Classical Studies
David Jones, Assistant Professor of English
Dorothy Bartlett, William Loadstone Professor of Environmental Studies
```

**titles of things**

A, An, The:

What to do with an initial, _A, An,_ or _The_ in a title when used in running text. Drop the initial article if it makes the text awkward.

`The Town’s College is one of our most useful reference books.`

`His Town’s College proved to be one of our most useful reference books.`

In running text, lowercase _the_ when it precedes the name of a society, association, building, or other proper name, even when it is part of the name. This also applies to _the_ in magazine and newspaper titles. Any initial _the_ in the titles of periodicals (journals, magazines, and newspapers) should be subsumed by the surrounding text or dropped.

`The project is funded through the Prudential Foundation.`

`Reading the New York Times is great way to start the day.`

When the name of an entity includes a definite article, such as “The Grille” or  “The Who,” it should be lowercased in running text. 

`We are eating lunch at the Grille and listening to the Who.`

In general:

Middlebury office names that are also used as general terms, such as _public affairs_, _admissions_, _alumni relations_, _financial services_, and government offices, such as _agriculture_, _commerce_, _defense_, _education_, _transportation_, should be lowercased when used in titles that don’t precede the name.

`He is the vice president of facilities services.`

`Sarah James, director of alumni relations.`

Courses:

Course titles combine the department code with a numerical designation and the title: JAPN 0101 First-Year Japanese. Place a space between the department code and the course number. Course titles are printed in roman type, capped, with no quotation marks. It is not necessary to include the course number in general interest texts.

`Professor Smith’s course the Beginning of the Universe has had a waiting list for several years.` (Note: lowercase _the_ even though it is part of the title of the course.)

Departments and Offices:

Running text—Departments and offices are capped only when the full, correct name is used.

`Go to the Office of the Dean of the College if you have questions.`

`Someone in the dean’s office will be able to help.`

`The Middlebury Museum of Art has a new installation.`

`There is a new installation at the art museum.`

Academic departments are always capped:

`The Department of Biology will move to the new science center.`

`All of the science departments, including the Biology Department, will move.`

In vertical lists—It is permissible to cap all offices and departments for the sake of consistency and readability. See [titles of people](#).

Web Works

_Blogs_

_Podcasts_

_Websites_

Website titles may consist of the name of the site, may use part of the domain name, or may refer to the entity responsible for the site.

In running text, use roman type, headline-style, without quotation marks. An initial _the_ is lowercased midsentence.

Google; Google Maps; White House.gov; Amazon

Some websites, however, are closely linked or completely similar to their print publications, and are therefore styled accordingly.

_Chicago Manual of Style Online_ has the answers to your questions.
I found the spelling in _Merriam-Webster.com_.

Titles of periodicals found both in print and online should be treated similarly, except for the domain name.

The website of the _New York Times_; the _New York Times_ online; NYTimes.com; www.middmag.com

Pages or sections of websites are capped, headline style, and placed in quotation marks.

Written Works

_Books_

Italicize book titles.

An initial _A, An_, or _The_ may be dropped if it does not fit the syntax of a sentence.

Use roman type, headline style, without quotation marks, for the names of book series or editions. The words series and edition are lowercased when they are not part of the title:

Norton Books Field Guide series

_Ebooks_

Italicize ebook titles. Use roman type and quotation marks for sections.

Please consult the ebook _Putting Your Passion to Work_, especially the section “What Do You Want to Do With Your Life?”

_Periodicals (newspapers, magazines, and newsletters)_

Capitalize and italicize, except for a “the” in the title. This is because some periodicals use “the” as part of their title and some do not; the most consistent approach is to leave it out of the italicized title:

The story appeared in the _Boston Globe_.

Periodical titles included in the names of awards, buildings, organizations are not italicized:

Middlebury Magazine Short Story Prize
