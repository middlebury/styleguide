**web addresses**

Try to avoid obscure technology references and long URLs. (You can use bitly.com to shrink long web addresses. Or you can direct readers to the right page: `Visit www.williams.edu, click on “Alumni,” and then “Golf Tournament.”`) When available, use a "go" link. If you are printing a document with a URL or email address in it, be sure to remove the hyperlink.

In running text, web addresses should be kept on one line whenever possible. If it is necessary to break a web address, do so before a form of punctuation (i.e., hyphen or period) or after a slash (/). Do not add a hyphen at the end of the line.

Example:

`www.middlebury.edu/offices/news/communications`

after line break:

```
www.middlebury.edu/offices/
news/communications
```

In running text, drop the “http://” or “www” before a web address unless the site will not load without it.

It can be helpful to style the address in a different typeface from the accompanying text (italic type within roman copy, for example) or to bold it so the reader comprehends it at a glance.

Sentence capitalization rules apply. The first letter of a sentence is always capitalized, whether it’s the e in eBay, or the i in iPod.
